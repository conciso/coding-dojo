# Tic Tac Toe Refactoring Kata

The exercise in this kata is the refactoring of the tic tac toe game. The story is the following:

The programmer who implemented this game interface has left the company and the kata has to be ready
in the next few days. In his last phone call the programmer said that he was nearly ready with it
and there are only some minor changes and tasks left.

The task for this kata is to review the source code and check it. To do this you first have to write
the test code for a method and then refactor it that the functionality stays the same. Please repeat
this until all methods are tested. Because the original programmer has not written any test please
additionally check the functionality against the interface which has been defined by the architect
together with the customer.

As add-on please create a simple console interface with the following functionality:

1. Ask for the size of the game grid
2. Ask for the names of the players
3. Show the grid and the players with their game tile and their number of moves.
4. Ask in changing order for the game move of the actual player and then repeat with step 3.
5. If a player has won the game show the name of the winner together with the needed moves.
6. Ask if the game should be played again and restart at step 1 if needed.
