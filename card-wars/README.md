Card-War
========
The card war game is a simple card game, where two player play against
each other. For this game a normal card deck is used. Each player
gets the same number of cards mixed randomly. 

Each player reveals the top card of his card stack and compares it with
the other one. The highest card wins and the player gets both cards
and puts them at the bottem of his card stack.

If the cards have the same value then each player puts the next three
cards of his stack and reveals the next card. The highest card wins 
and the winning player gets all cards.

Aces are high and suits are ignored.
