# Reversi-Kata

In this Kata we are going to build a reversi game (the modern version is called Othello). This strategy board game 
is played on a 8x8 uncheckered board with black and white disc stones. Goal of the game is that you remove all 
discs of your opponent or have the most discs on the board when all fields are covered or no valid move is possible.

It starts with a setting where you (W) and the opponent player (B) have two discs on the board.

```
........
........
........
...WB...
...BW...
........
........
........
```

The rule for the game is that you can set a disc, when there is at least one disc of your opponent between the new
one and an already set one. If the move is valid (o), all discs of your opponent in between your new disc and your 
already set discs are exchanged into yours. 

```
........       ........
........       ........
....o...       ....W...
...WBo..  ==>  ...WW...
..oBW...       ...BW...
...o....       ........
........       ........
........       ........
```

The goal of the kata is to implement an algorithm which calculates all valid moves for a given player.

For this purpose there is a method in the `Reversi` Interface `calculateMoves(Player player)` which has to be 
implemented and guided by tests.
