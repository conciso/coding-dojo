Diamond 
========
In this code kata you must give a letter as parameter into the method to implement and 
this must create a String with a diamond around it.

E.g.: Given letter 'f':
```text
     a
    b b
   c   c
  d     d
 e       e
f         f
 e       e
  d     d
   c   c
    b b
     a
```
or with letter 'c':
```text
     a
    b b
   c   c
    b b
     a
```
