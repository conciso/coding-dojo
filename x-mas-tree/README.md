# Code Kata Xmas tree
In this code kata we create an xmas tree as ascii art. An xmas tree with the branch size 5 should be drawn
like this:

```
    X
   XXX
  XXXXX
 XXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
    I
```
Additionally there could be a star on the top of the tree:
```
    *
    X
   XXX
  XXXXX
 XXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
    I
```

The exercise is to create a tree with variable size of branches and with or without star at the top.

If the exercise seems to be too easy then some constraints could be used, e.g.:
 * No usage of loops
 * No usage of lambdas and loops
 * No usages of if-then-else expression
 * No local and member variables
